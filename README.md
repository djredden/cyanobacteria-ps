# cyanobacteria-ps
Code associated with "An innovative passive sampling approach for the detection of cyanobacterial gene targets in freshwater sources" by David Redden, Toni Stanhope, Lindsay E. Anderson, Jessica Campbell, Wendy Krkosek, and Graham A. Gagnon. 

The code folder contains scripts used to:
1. clean the raw qPCR files for both field (field_data_cleaning.R) and bench-scale work (adsorption_data_cleaning.R)
2. analyze data from adsorption experiments (analysis.R)
3. quality control for field qPCR data (field_qa_qc.R)
4. generate the figures shown in the manuscript and SI (figure_2.R - figure_4.R)
5. generate the figure shown in the graphical abstract (gr_abstract.R)
6. functions required for the analyses (functions.R)
